                - Raid clear calculator
                    - tools: python, regEX
                    - goal: calculate the total amount of time spent by all players playing each of Destiny2's raids on day one.
                    - solution: scrape the html pages of the stats, provided by raidreport.com. Use regEX to get and format all of the 
                        times, then put the times in a list. Finaly add all of the times together, using basic python calculations.
                - motorcycle lighting system
                    - tools: micro python
                    - hardware: raspberry pi pico
                    - goal: make a universal LED under glow system for a motorcycle
                    - solustion: use LED strips along with a raspbery py  pico to produece the lighting. The raspberry py sets the colors
                        based on the position in an list and a button click
            - for fun/ amature
                - FoodMap
                    - tools: java, spring boot, java script, html, css, react, postgreSQL, docker
                    - goal: make a webapp that functionaly replaces yelp. This webapp will take the users location then load load a map with
                        recomended restaurants in a set radious. The user can also select to see restaurants revewed by other users, groups,
                        and restaurants they revewed. These restaurants will be dispalayed in a list from and on an interactive map.
                    - solution: use springboot and postgreSQL to make a back end, to handle all user requests. Then make a fruntend using 
                        react, of wich the home page will be the restaurants that are best reviewed in the vasinity.
                - N-Body Simulation
                    - tools: c
                    - goal: make a n-bodys Simulation that solves for user input.
                    - solution: use the barnes-hut algorithm to make a multythreaded n-bodys Simulation.
                - Income Predictor
                    - tools: python, scikit learn, pandas
                    - goal: train multiple AI with difrent algorithms to solve priedic a persons income from census data. then analice each 
                        algorithm for potential biases and preformance. 
                    - solution: use pandas to organice the data from the census. Then train and evalueta the accuracy of support vector machines,
                        random forest, logistic regression, and nearest neighbors classification algorithms. Next remove columns from data 
                        and evalueta the accuracy for each algorithm. finaly cheak common biases, such as sex, race, and nationality.
                - Connect 4 AI
                    - tools: python
                    - goal: creat an ai that can compeat in connect 4.
                    - solution: use pyton to creat a connect 4 with a command line interface. Then use the minimax algorithm to make an ai that
                        to play. Next train the heuriatic with the genteic algorithm, by having 2 AI play each other one with a set huristioc and 
                        the other with the one constantly changing.
                - Windows Hacker Board
                    - tools: micro python
                    - hardware: raspberry py pico
                    - goal: download folders onto attacked computer when raspberry pi is pluged in.
                    - solution: use a raspberry py pico to function as a mouse and keyboard. When pluged in the py will open settings snd dissable 
                        windows defender. then open command prompt and downlaod a file and run it.
